# Web Design Critique Prompt

You are evaluating a static web design (e.g., Figma export, mockup, or prototype). Your task is to critically analyze the work across the following categories. Assess *specific design decisions*—not general impressions—and articulate strengths, failures, and opportunities for refinement.

---

## 1. Aesthetics & Visual Design
- **Color system**: Does the palette support the mood and function of the site? Are primary, secondary, and accent colors clearly defined and used consistently?
- **Contrast and accessibility**: Are background/text combinations readable (especially on mobile or for vision-impaired users)? Do any elements fall below WCAG AA/AAA thresholds?
- **Typography**:
  - Are font families appropriate to the brand, context, and content types?
  - Is there clear visual differentiation between headings, subheadings, and body copy?
  - Are line heights, spacing, and alignment consistent across the site?

---

## 2. Layout, Composition & Spatial System
- Is there effective use of **grids or modular systems**? Are visual units consistent across different sections and pages?
- Identify **alignment issues**, inconsistencies in spacing, or irregular element positioning.
- **Section pacing**: Is there a balance between content-dense and breathing space sections? Does the scroll rhythm feel intentional or repetitive?
- Is the **fold line** considered on the landing screen? What information is prioritized above/below it?

---

## 3. Usability & Accessibility
- **Navigation**:
  - Are nav items clear, logically ordered, and consistent across the site?
  - Is the menu system (header, footer, drawer, etc.) intuitive and scannable?
- **Interaction affordance**: Can users easily distinguish between clickable and static elements?
- **Accessibility**:
  - Is semantic structure implied (e.g., heading hierarchy)?
  - Are CTA buttons large enough, with accessible labels and touch targets?
  - Are designs friendly to keyboard navigation and screen readers?

---

## 4. Content Strategy & Messaging
- Is the **core message** or value proposition evident within the first 5 seconds?
- Are headings and supporting text **scannable and information-rich**, or vague/generic?
- **Tone and voice**: Do written elements reflect a coherent identity across the site?
- Are there **redundancies**, overly technical phrases, or mismatches between text and visuals?

---

## 5. Visual Hierarchy & Information Architecture
- Is information **layered and structured** clearly using size, weight, position, and color?
- Does user attention flow logically from top to bottom and section to section?
- Are any sections competing visually or conceptually for attention?
- Is there a **clear progression** (intro → problem → solution → proof → CTA)?

---

## 6. Interactivity & System Feedback *(as applicable)*
- Are interactive components (e.g., buttons, dropdowns, carousels) **visually distinct and labeled**?
- Are **hover, active, and loading states** represented or accounted for?
- Are **error and success states** considered for forms, searches, etc.?
- Does the interface anticipate **user intent and mistakes** (e.g., undo, validation)?

---

## 7. Originality & Appropriateness
- Does the design show **original thinking**, or replicate conventional templates?
- Is the **design vocabulary aligned** with the brand, product, and target audience?
- Are there signs of **visual or structural redundancy** (e.g., repeated layouts without variation)?

---

## 8. Responsiveness & Scalability
- Is there evidence of **mobile-first thinking**, or does the design assume desktop only?
- Are components designed for **modularity and reuse**?
- Would the layout degrade **gracefully across breakpoints**?
- Could this design accommodate future **content expansion** (e.g., more services, new sections)?

---

## 9. Technical Design Readiness
- Is the design **buildable** using standard front-end technologies?
- Are components logically structured and **clearly spec’d**?
- Are image/icon assets consistent in format, resolution, and usage?
- If annotations are present, are they **complete and developer-usable**?

---

## Instructions
- Use direct, specific language. Reference particular frames, screens, or elements (e.g., “In Frame 5, the hero text over the background image fails contrast tests”).
- Offer at least **one actionable suggestion per category**.
- Avoid generic praise. Explain *why* something works or doesn’t using design principles.
- If the project is unfinished, comment on **what’s missing** and suggest how to prioritize next steps.
